        Turn off the Bluetooth and that is it.\n\nWith BluModify you can start tracking your Bluetooth activity.
        If no device is connected and Bluetooth is on, you will get notification about it.
        You can than decide if you want to turn off the Bluetooth.
        The detection runs every 15 mins approximately, so the app consumption is minimal.
        Unfortunately, the ability to turn off Bluetooth is solely in user\'s hands as Android removed this ability.

    <string name="about_screen_text">
        The BluModify serves to check on the Bluetooth activity and prevent redundant running of the Bluetooth on the phone.
        The running Bluetooth can lead to exploit of Bluetooth weaknesses and battery drainage.
        If the Bluetooth runs and there is no device connected, there is no point in running it.
        Here comes BluModify, which can alert you with notification about this situation and you can turn off the Bluetooth.
        Unfortunately, with advanced versions of Android, the Bluetooth can be turned off only manually by user.
